Here is the text document for us to discuss ANY issues we may face.
Feel free to type anything here to talk about it.

(need discussion) Question 1: How about we use this as a way of group communication, and check this document at least once every day?
(Response 1)

Couple things:
    1) I think we need a better way to communicate with each other like
    wechat(my wechat id is AlvinCao88 if we go with this), or even discord,
    lets decide on something. Because if there is an fast changes we might 
    need something better than this.
    2) I also added a potential design we could use would love some
    feedback <3.
    3) I'm not to sure, if all the members are added in the git and jira. 
    4) we should find a time to meet up to discuss about some stuff like 
    the design, color scheme, etc.

(Follow-up 1)
    1) Agree, I have created a WeChat group if we prefer WeChat.
